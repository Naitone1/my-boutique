# My Boutique and photo app

A Next.js 14 template for building apps with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Goal of the app 


This is a Next.js application that combines three main features: a photo gallery, an online boutique, and a blog. It's designed to provide a seamless and interactive experience for users who want to explore images, shop for products, and read blog posts.

## Features

1. **Gallery**: View a collection of photos, images, and artwork in a visually appealing gallery format. Users can click on images to see them in detail and may have options for filtering and sorting.

2. **Boutique**: Shop for a variety of products, goods, or services. Users can browse, search, and make purchases within the boutique section.

3. **Blog**: Read blog posts, articles, and news related to the subject matter of your application. Users can interact with blog posts, leave comments, and share content on social media.
